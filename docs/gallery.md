The main dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your document library. The clean, modern interface displays documents in an organized grid layout with thumbnails for quick visual identification. The left sidebar offers easy access to navigation, labels, and sources, while the top bar provides quick actions for uploading, searching, and managing your documents. Notice the document statistics at the top showing total documents, processing status, and storage usage.

## Advanced Search Interface

Readur's search capabilities go far beyond simple keyword matching. This view demonstrates the advanced search interface where you can combine multiple criteria, use boolean operators, and filter by document properties. The search results display instantly with highlighted matching terms, making it easy to identify relevant documents. The faceted filtering on the left allows you to further refine results by date, document type, labels, and OCR status.

## Document Processing & OCR

## Label Management System

The drag-and-drop interface makes it simple to reorganize your label hierarchy as your needs evolve.

## Source Configuration

Configure multiple document sources to automatically sync with Readur. This interface shows the source configuration panel where you can set up connections to WebDAV servers, S3-compatible storage, or local folders. Each source can have its own sync schedule, filters, and processing rules. The health monitoring indicators show the status of each source, ensuring your documents are always up to date.

## Document Detail View
