## Troubleshooting

### Data Not Updating

When analytics data appears stale or stops updating, systematic troubleshooting can quickly identify the issue. First, check system time synchronization between your application servers and database - time drift can cause data to appear in the wrong time windows or prevent real-time updates from displaying correctly.

Next, verify that the analytics service is running properly by checking service status and reviewing recent logs for errors. Database connectivity issues can also prevent data updates, so confirm that connection pools are healthy and queries are completing successfully. Sometimes the issue is client-side - clearing your browser cache and performing a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) can resolve display problems.

It's also worth checking if scheduled data aggregation jobs are running as expected and whether there's sufficient disk space for temporary analytics data. If problems persist, review the analytics service configuration to ensure all required environment variables are set correctly.

### Performance Issues

Analytics dashboard performance issues often stem from a few common causes that can be systematically addressed. Start by monitoring database query performance using built-in profiling tools to identify slow queries that might need optimization or additional indexes.

Large datasets can overwhelm both backend and frontend systems, so check if your queries are returning excessive data that should be paginated or aggregated before display. Review your concurrent user limits as multiple simultaneous dashboard users can strain system resources, particularly during peak hours or when generating complex reports.

If performance issues persist after optimization, consider increasing system resources - particularly RAM for caching frequently accessed data and CPU cores for parallel query processing. Additionally, implementing a dedicated analytics database replica can offload reporting queries from your primary database, and adding Redis caching for frequently accessed metrics can dramatically improve response times.

### Missing Data Points

When specific metrics or time periods show missing data, investigate several potential causes to restore complete analytics coverage. Begin by verifying that log collection is enabled for all relevant components - sometimes logging gets disabled during troubleshooting or maintenance and isn't re-enabled.

Data retention policies might be automatically purging older analytics data to manage storage space. Review these policies to ensure they align with your reporting requirements, and consider adjusting retention periods or archiving strategies if historical data is needed. Source configuration is another common culprit - verify that all data sources are properly configured to send metrics to the analytics system.

Permission issues can cause data gaps when the analytics service lacks access to certain data sources or when user permissions filter out data inadvertently. Furthermore, check for time zone misconfigurations that might cause data to appear in unexpected time windows, and verify that data collection hasn't been paused due to maintenance mode or system overload protection.
